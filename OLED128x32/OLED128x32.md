## Wiring Steps Diagram for ESP32S3 Development Board and Each Module

First, a complete picture

![Img](media/ks5025.jpg)

The first step is to clip the breadboard together, which is done with clips.

![](media/acc56c2d0290d6f6fda6520beaa86e5f.jpeg)

The second step shows that the breadboard has 6 protrusions on top.

![](media/6d668823a3deba4f249e9e0478534da4.jpeg)

Start connecting the ESP32 development board. Align the board starting from the left side A1 and press against the bottom hole.

![Img](media/img-20250409150755.png)

The third step begins the wiring, taking care to align with the pins. If unsure how to interpret the wiring, you can refer to the numbers. For the round INMP441 wiring:

![Img](media/img-20250409152333.png)

Then insert the INMP441 as illustrated.

![](media/96d01530f237d6c78c5751c2520c11e9.jpeg)

The fourth step is the 0.91-inch display.

![Img](media/img-20250409153055.png)

The fifth step is to wire the MAX98357:

![Img](media/img-20250409154325.png)

After connecting the wires, insert the amplifier: the three orange wires align with the amplifier's LRC/BCLK/DIN.

Now you can proceed to the next step, which is network configuration.

## Common Wiring Issues FAQ

1. After flashing the firmware, the RGB light does not turn on  
   - Please check whether the solder joints around the RGB light are properly soldered. If there are any unsoldered places, you can first use wires to connect the corresponding pads and check if the light can be operated normally after restarting.

2. How to check for circuit faults?  
   - When not powered: You can use a multimeter to measure continuity between wires and GND or 3.3V pins, checking for short or open circuits.  
   - When powered: Measure the voltage values between GND and other pins to see if they are within normal ranges (e.g., 5V, 3.3V); if abnormal, further checking the corresponding module and wires is necessary.

3. Why should the four-pin button be staggered in the breadboard?  
   - Among the four-pin button, the two Same-direction pins are interconnected; if inserted in the same row, it will cause a short circuit, and the button will not work properly. It is essential to split the four pins into two rows for proper functioning.

4. Can I²C (SDA/SCL) and I²S (BCLK/LRCLK/DIN, etc.) pins be shared?  
   - It is not recommended. The hardware signal formats, timing, and protocols of I²C and I²S are incompatible, so each must use its corresponding GPIO pins.

5. Why do the volume adjustment buttons have no effect or are always muted?  
   - Please ensure that the buttons are connected to the correct GPIO (for example, 39 and 40), and that the "volume up / volume down" button pins are not reversed. If the hardware is correct, double-check the firmware version and sample code configuration for compatibility.

6. What to do when contact problems frequently occur when using the breadboard?  
   - This may be due to aging breadboard sockets or oxidation of component pins. You can try replacing with a new breadboard, cleaning the component pins, or using shorter jumper wires to reduce points of failure.

7. How to connect the grounds of sensors, power modules, etc.?  
   - The ground of external modules should be connected to the GND of the main control board, ensuring they all share the same ground line to avoid noise or signal stability issues.

> Tip: If you encounter problems that are difficult to locate, you can check if the power supply is stable (e.g., 5V or 3.3V power supply) and ensure that the firmware version and sample code correspond to the actual wiring situation.

## Flashing the Firmware (Without IDF Development Environment)

This guide is applicable to the ESP32-S3-WROOM-N16R8 version for firmware flashing, using the Flash Download Tool.

One-click download for flashing tool

![](media/67e3d89096b079957270155a1bb9f545.png) [Flashing Tool](Tool.zip)

- Operating System: Taking Windows as an example, it is recommended to use Flash Download Tool 3.9.7 (or other newer versions).  
- Get the Tool: Download from [Espressif's official website](https://www.espressif.com.cn/zh-hans/support/download/other-tools) and extract to any folder, no installation required.  
- Running Method: Enter the extracted directory and double-click `flash_download_tool_3.9.7.exe` to start.

## Downloading the Firmware

One-click download for flashing firmware

![](media/67e3d89096b079957270155a1bb9f545.png) [Flashing Firmware](Firmware.zip)

After extraction, you will obtain the `merged-binary.bin` file.


Click to download, then extract.

Copy the `.bin` File to the Specified Directory  
It is recommended to place the extracted `merged-binary.bin` in the bin directory of Flash Download Tool for easier subsequent operations.

## Flashing the Firmware / Downloading to the Development Board

After extracting and entering the `flash_download_tool_3.9.7` directory, double-click to run `flash_download_tool_3.9.7.exe`. The interface appears as follows:

### 1) Download Settings

1. Chip Type (ChipType): Select `ESP32-S3`  
2. Working Mode (WorkMode): Select `Develop`  
3. Loading Mode (Download Mode): It is recommended to choose `UART` (if selecting USB, additional settings are required, not covered here)

![](media/38b46d212825491291a35bb8bc011d83.jpeg)

Connecting and sRGB Explanation:  
- When the Type-C interface of the development board is facing you, the right port is the UART port and the left port is the USB port; please do not confuse them.  
- If the onboard sRGB light has not been soldered, the tool may show a warning when identifying (does not affect flashing), which can later be resolved by shorting the solder pads (see the end of the document).

### 2) Loading Firmware & SPI Download Settings

1. Input Firmware Path: Click the `...` button in the first blank field and select the `merged-binary.bin` file.

![](media/be6bee946a9baa153cbfd68a47b00b52.jpeg)

2. Check the Firmware Options: Check the checkbox before the imported `.bin` file and enter `0x0` or `0x00` in the address bar to indicate that it will be flashed to the starting address of the storage.  
3. COM Port: In the system's "Device Manager", expand the serial port project to view the corresponding COM port number and select the same port in the tool.  
![Img](media/img-20250419110408.png)

4. Speed Settings: The default SPI speed is fine; you can choose a higher `BAUD` rate to speed up the flashing.

 2) Configuration State
- sRGB Color Light Blinking Blue: Indicates that it is in configuration mode.  
- sRGB Color Light Not On: Refer to the second section of this page for details.  
- If the device is not in configuration mode or needs to be reconfigured, press and hold the configuration button (connect to GPIO 1), then press the RST button to reset; first release RST, then release the configuration button to re-enter configuration mode.  
- With firmware version ≥0.2.2, if three attempts to connect to the original Wi-Fi fail, it will automatically return to configuration mode (when switching networks, you can press RST to restart the device).

 3) Configuration Steps
   Connect to "Xiao Zhi" Wi-Fi  
   Use your phone or computer to connect to the Wi-Fi emitted by the device (the name usually resembles *Xiaozhi-XXXXXX*).

   > - Select 2.4G Wi-Fi (if using an iPhone hotspot, you need to enable “maximum compatibility”).  
   > - Enter the password, then click Connect.  
   > - If connected successfully, the screen will display “Done,” and it will restart automatically after 3 seconds.

If the automatic redirection to the configuration page does not occur, you can also manually enter `http://192.168.4.1` in the browser’s address bar to access the configuration page.

### 2. About the RGB Color Light on the Device

1. Connection and Update Status  
   - After power on, if the blue light blinks once: the device is connecting to Wi-Fi; if subsequently green light blinks, it indicates successful connection and can be awakened by voice.  
   - If the blue light stays on: it is performing OTA firmware updates, typically completing in under a minute.  
   - If the blue light keeps blinking: the device is in configuration mode.  
   - If awakened by voice, the blue light will turn on: indicates connecting to the server.  
   - If the green light is on: the device is playing audio.  
   - If the red light is on: the device is recording audio.

2. RGB Color Light Not On  
   - If the light switch has not been soldered, it won’t affect network configuration, but will make it impossible to view device status.
